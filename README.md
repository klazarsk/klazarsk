- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Kimberly Lazarski
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Linux, Roller Derby, Corvettes, Kia Stingers, shooting sports, photography, physics
- This is an account I use for training at work for my role in openshift and storage at Red Hat
- I may be using it for open source projects after I get a few prerequisite certifications out of the way
- One of the projects you will eventually find here is a suite of sysadmin tools I will be developing
- No ETA on apearance of the projects
